NLP

This repository shows four programming assignments done for natural language processing. 

The first one is building a modern phrase-based statistical machine translation system. It has two main components: implementation 
of the IBM word alignment models and feature engineering for an MT decoder.

The second one implements a parsing algorithm for a broad coverage statistical treebank parser and test the algorihtm on the
WSJ section of the Penn Treebank.

The third one implements two coreference resolution systems: the first system is rule-based while the second one is based on 
a discriminative statistical classifier.

The fourth one implement a neural network for named entity recognition: including the word embedding layer, the feedforward 
neural network and the corresponding backpropagation training algorithm.
